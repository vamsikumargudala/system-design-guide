## System Design Interview Framework

### Step-by-Step Approach (Follow this exact sequence):

**Step 1: Clarify Requirements (5-10 minutes)**
- **Functional Requirements**: What the system should do
  - "What are the core features we need to support?"
  - "What is the expected user behavior?"
  - "Are there any specific business constraints?"

- **Non-Functional Requirements**: How the system should perform
  - "How many users do we expect?"
  - "What is the expected read/write ratio?"
  - "What are the latency requirements?"
  - "Do we need high availability?"

**Step 2: Estimation and Constraints (5-10 minutes)**
- **Scale Estimation**:
  - Daily Active Users (DAU)
  - Queries Per Second (QPS)
  - Storage requirements
  - Bandwidth requirements

- **Example Calculation**:
  ```
  100M DAU × 10 requests/day = 1B requests/day
  1B requests/day ÷ 86,400 seconds = ~12K QPS
  Peak traffic = 2-3× average = ~30K QPS
  ```

**Step 3: High-Level Design (10-15 minutes)**
- Draw basic system components
- Show data flow between components
- Identify major services/modules
- Keep it simple initially

**Step 4: Detailed Design (15-20 minutes)**
- Deep dive into critical components
- Database schema design
- API design
- Algorithm details
- Address specific requirements

**Step 5: Scale and Optimize (5-10 minutes)**
- Identify bottlenecks
- Propose scaling solutions
- Discuss trade-offs
- Address failure scenarios

**Step 6: Wrap Up (2-5 minutes)**
- Summarize the design
- Discuss monitoring and metrics
- Mention additional considerations

## Success Tips for System Design

1. **Start Simple**: Always begin with a basic design, then add complexity
2. **Ask Questions**: Clarify requirements before diving into design
3. **Think Out Loud**: Explain your thought process during interviews
4. **Draw Diagrams**: Visual representations help communicate ideas
5. **Discuss Trade-offs**: Every decision has pros and cons
6. **Stay Current**: Follow tech blogs and architecture updates
7. **Practice Regularly**: Consistency is key for retention
8. **Learn from Real Systems**: Study how major platforms are architected

Remember: System design is about trade-offs, not perfect solutions. Focus on understanding the reasoning behind design decisions rather than memorizing specific architectures.
