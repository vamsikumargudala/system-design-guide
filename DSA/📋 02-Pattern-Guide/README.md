# ðŸ“‹ Pattern Guide - Master DSA Patterns

## The Heart of Your DSA Learning

This section contains your core learning materials - the patterns that will help you solve 90% of coding interview questions.

## ðŸ“– Files in This Section

### 1. `Pattern_Cheat_Sheet.md`
**Your Quick Reference Guide**
- 15 essential DSA patterns
- Pattern recognition keywords
- When to use each pattern
- Template approaches for each pattern
- Quick decision tree for pattern identification

### 2. `DSA_Pattern_Practice_Sheet.md`
**Your Complete Problem Set**
- 10-15 carefully curated problems per pattern
- 150+ total problems organized by difficulty
- Direct LeetCode links for each problem
- Pattern-specific tips and tricks
- Time and space complexity targets

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Strategy

### Phase 1: Pattern Recognition (Week 1-2)
1. **Study `Pattern_Cheat_Sheet.md` thoroughly**
   - Understand each pattern's use case
   - Memorize pattern keywords
   - Practice identifying patterns from problem descriptions

### Phase 2: Systematic Practice (Week 3+)
1. **Use `DSA_Pattern_Practice_Sheet.md` systematically**
   - Pick one pattern at a time
   - Solve 3-5 easy problems first
   - Move to medium, then hard problems
   - Master one pattern before moving to the next

## ðŸ“Š The 15 Core Patterns

1. **Arrays & Hashing** - Foundation problems
2. **Two Pointers** - Array/string manipulation
3. **Sliding Window** - Subarray/substring problems
4. **Stack** - Parentheses, monotonic stack
5. **Binary Search** - Search in sorted arrays
6. **Linked List** - Fast & slow pointers
7. **Trees** - DFS, BFS traversals
8. **Tries** - Prefix trees
9. **Heap/Priority Queue** - Top K problems
10. **Backtracking** - Combinations, permutations
11. **Graphs** - DFS, BFS, shortest path
12. **Dynamic Programming** - 1D & 2D DP
13. **Intervals** - Merge, overlap detection
14. **Greedy** - Local optimal choices
15. **Bit Manipulation** - XOR, bit operations

## âš¡ Action Items

- [ ] Read `Pattern_Cheat_Sheet.md` completely
- [ ] Choose your first pattern from `DSA_Pattern_Practice_Sheet.md`
- [ ] Set up progress tracking in `03-Progress-Tracking`
- [ ] Start with 2-3 easy problems in your chosen pattern

## ðŸ”— Next Steps

While working through patterns, use:
**ðŸ“Š [03-Progress-Tracking](../ðŸ“Š%2003-Progress-Tracking/)** - Track your daily progress
