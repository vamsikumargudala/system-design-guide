## 🛡️ Anti-Frustration Protocols

### When Stuck (15-minute rule):
1. **0-5 min**: Try to understand problem
2. **5-10 min**: Write pseudocode
3. **10-15 min**: Look at hints (not solution)
4. **After 15 min**: Watch explanation video, then retry

### Bad Day Protocol:
- Solve one "comfort zone" problem
- Review a previously solved problem
- Watch a motivational coding video
- Remember: Showing up counts!

### Burnout Prevention:
- **Mandatory rest days**: Every 7th day
- **Light days**: When energy < 5/10
- **Variety days**: Switch to different content (videos, articles)
- **Social days**: Pair programming or discussion

## 🎯 Problem Curation Strategy

### Problem Selection Criteria:
1. **Frequency**: Appears in top companies
2. **Teaching Value**: Introduces key concepts
3. **Building Blocks**: Foundations for harder problems
4. **Confidence Builders**: Strategic easy wins

### Difficulty Progression:
- Week 1-2: 80% Easy, 20% Medium
- Week 3-6: 60% Easy, 40% Medium
- Week 7-12: 40% Easy, 50% Medium, 10% Hard
- Week 13+: 20% Easy, 60% Medium, 20% Hard

## 📱 Daily Habit Triggers

### Morning Routine Integration:
1. Coffee/Tea + DSA problem
2. Before checking social media
3. Set specific time (e.g., 8:00 AM)

### Environment Setup:
- Dedicated workspace
