Requirement Document for Structured DSA Practice Guide
Objective
Create a structured, easy-to-follow study guide that groups the most important and frequently asked Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) coding questions by design patterns. This resource aims to help learners practice effectively and systematically without random guessing.

Scope
Focus on popular DSA design patterns and categories widely used in coding interviews.

Curate a targeted list of high-impact coding problems for each pattern.

Provide contextual explanations and links for efficient learning.

Instructions
1. Organization by Design Patterns
Categorize problems under major DSA patterns such as:

Sliding Window

Two Pointers

Dynamic Programming

Backtracking

Recursion

Graph Algorithms

Tree Traversal

Greedy Algorithms

Divide and Conquer

Each category should include a concise definition of the pattern and when to apply it.

2. Question Curation
For each pattern, list 10-15 most commonly asked, high-quality questions relevant to the pattern.

Include problem title, source platform (e.g., LeetCode, HackerRank), difficulty level, and a direct link to the problem.

3. Format and Accessibility
Deliver the guide as a spreadsheet or markdown files organized by pattern.

Ensure clear headings and easy navigation for progressive learning.

Optional: include columns/sections for marking progress or notes.

4. Learning Aids (Optional but Recommended)
Add brief tips or common pitfalls for solving problems using each pattern.

Include sample code snippets or pseudocode references for common approaches.

Provide advice on how to analyze and break down problems in each category.

Deliverables
A structured, pattern-wise list of DSA problems with explanations.

Well-organized files or sheets that facilitate systematic practice.

(Optional) Supplementary notes or tips to deepen understanding.

Constraints
Avoid random or low-value questions.

Keep the list focused, concise, and relevant to typical interview patterns.

Prioritize clarity and ease of use.

If you need, this can be tailored further for implementation as an MCP prompt or Claude instruction file. Would that be helpful?


    I've analyzed your system-design-guide repository and will create a comprehensive DSA practice sheet organized by design 
    patterns. Here's my plan:

    What I'll Create:

    1. DSA_Pattern_Practice_Sheet.md - A comprehensive markdown file with:
      - 15+ core DSA patterns with clear explanations
      - 10-15 carefully curated problems per pattern
      - Problems sorted by difficulty (Easy â†’ Medium â†’ Hard)
      - Direct LeetCode links for each problem
      - Pattern recognition tips
      - Time/space complexity targets
    2. DSA_Daily_Tracker.csv - A CSV spreadsheet for tracking:
      - Problem name, pattern, difficulty
      - Date attempted, time taken
      - Solution approach notes
      - Review schedule columns
    3. Pattern_Cheat_Sheet.md - Quick reference with:
      - Pattern identification flowchart
      - Common interview patterns and when to use them
      - Template code snippets for each pattern

    The 15 Core Patterns I'll Cover:

    1. Arrays & Hashing - Foundation problems
    2. Two Pointers - Array/string manipulation
    3. Sliding Window - Subarray/substring problems  
    4. Stack - Parentheses, monotonic stack
    5. Binary Search - Search in sorted arrays
    6. Linked List - Fast & slow pointers
    7. Trees - DFS, BFS traversals
    8. Tries - Prefix trees
    9. Heap/Priority Queue - Top K problems
    10. Backtracking - Combinations, permutations
    11. Graphs - DFS, BFS, shortest path
    12. Dynamic Programming - 1D & 2D DP
    13. Intervals - Merge, overlap detection
    14. Greedy - Local optimal choices
    15. Bit Manipulation - XOR, bit operations

    Each pattern will include:
    - When to use: Pattern recognition tips
    - Key concepts: Core techniques to master
    - Template approach: Step-by-step solving strategy
    - Most asked problems: Sorted by interview frequency
    - Practice progression: Easy â†’ Medium â†’ Hard path

    This approach will help you:
    - Learn patterns systematically instead of solving random problems
    - Recognize patterns quickly in interviews
    - Build confidence through structured progression
    - Track your progress effectively

    Shall I proceed with creating these files?
