# üí° Solutions - Your Code Library

## Build Your Personal Solution Collection

This section is where you'll store your coded solutions as you progress through the patterns.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

### `Easy/`
**Beginner-Friendly Problems**
- Start here for each new pattern
- Focus on understanding the pattern logic
- Build confidence with straightforward implementations

### `Medium/`
**Intermediate Challenges**
- Move here after mastering easy problems
- More complex pattern applications
- Multiple approach comparisons

### `Hard/`
**Advanced Algorithmic Problems**
- Complex pattern combinations
- Optimization challenges
- Interview-level difficulty

## üéØ Organization Strategy

### File Naming Convention
```
[Pattern]_[Problem-Name]_[Difficulty].extension

Examples:
- TwoPointers_ContainerWithMostWater_Medium.py
- DynamicProgramming_CoinChange_Medium.java
- BinarySearch_SearchInRotatedArray_Hard.cpp
```

### Solution Template
Each solution file should include:
```
# Problem: [Problem Name]
# Pattern: [DSA Pattern Used]
# Difficulty: [Easy/Medium/Hard]
# Time Complexity: O(?)
# Space Complexity: O(?)
# LeetCode Link: [Direct URL]

# Approach:
# 1. [Step 1 explanation]
# 2. [Step 2 explanation]
# 3. [Key insights]

[Your Code Here]

# Notes:
# - [Any insights or gotchas]
# - [Alternative approaches considered]
# - [Areas for optimization]
```

## üìà Growth Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Building
- Code 2-3 easy problems per pattern
- Focus on correctness over optimization
- Document your thought process

### Phase 2: Pattern Mastery
- Solve 5+ medium problems per pattern
- Compare multiple approaches
- Optimize time/space complexity

### Phase 3: Interview Readiness
- Tackle hard problems confidently
- Implement solutions under time pressure
- Practice explaining your approach

## üõ†Ô∏è Best Practices

### Code Quality
- **Clean, readable code**
- **Meaningful variable names**
- **Proper commenting**
- **Edge case handling**

### Documentation
- **Problem understanding**
- **Approach explanation**
